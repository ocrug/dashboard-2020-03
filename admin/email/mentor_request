Hi:

The Orange County R Users Group will be hosting a Zoom data science hackathon on April 10th and 11th.  We would like to provide mentors with a strong background in data analysis. That is where you would come in. We would very much like to invite you to be a mentor to these teams. 

What does this involve?  You would go into a breakout room with a team and guide them in solving their data problems. Most teams are very excited to get some guidance and some teams just want to bounce ideas off you. You can give them as much or as little assistance as they need. Once you are finished with one team you can move onto another team.

What is the commitment? Well, that is up to you. The mentoring period will be Saturday afternoon to early evening and again Sunday morning. We are asking you to commit a little or as much time as you would like. 

Would you be interested in helping out?

Cheers
John
